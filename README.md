# Design-Geodetic-Networks

# MATLAB Project Guide

## Overview

This MATLAB script provides a GUI-based tool for working with geodetic network data. Users can select various operations related to lines, angles, and azimuths, input data, and perform analyses such as optimization and visualization.

## Steps

1. **Initialization**

   - Clear the workspace and set initial variables.
   - Define the initial chi-square value used in calculations.

2. **Project Selection**

   - A menu allows users to choose the project they want to see:
     1. Design Geodetic Networks
     2. FOD xp yp
     3. FOD6
     4. END

   - Based on the user's choice, the script executes different operations.

3. **Design Geodetic Networks**

   - **Data Input**

     - Users can input data related to lines, angles, and azimuths. Data is read from text files using the `uigetfile` function.
     - Users can input errors for lines, angles, and azimuths.
     - A loop allows users to choose which data they want to input and generate new data files as needed.

   - **Data Processing**

     - Perform calculations based on the selected data type(s):
       - **Lines and Angles**
       - **Just Lines**
       - **Just Angles**
       - **Lines and Azimuth**

     - Calculate various parameters including Jacobians, coordinate adjustments, and covariance matrices.
     - Use error estimates to adjust data and compute standard deviations.

   - **Visualization**

     - Plot ellipses representing the uncertainty of the coordinates.
     - Show relative errors and visualize the results using various plotting functions.

   - **ZOD (Zeroing of Distance)**

     - Identify the best point for fixing the coordinates by adjusting errors and evaluating the effects.

   - **FOD (Field of Directions)**

     - Optimize coordinates by iteratively adjusting and evaluating the field of directions.

4. **FOD xp yp**

   - **x=50 y=?**

     - Compute the y-coordinate based on a fixed x-coordinate and plot the results to find the optimal y.

   - **x=? & y=?**

     - Compute both x and y coordinates within a specified range and plot the results.

5. **FOD6**

   - **Number of Points**

     - Analyze and optimize data for a specified number of points and box size.

## Code Description

The script is structured as follows:

- **Initialization**: Sets up the environment and initial variables.
- **Data Input**: Reads data files and allows users to specify errors and options.
- **Data Processing**: Calculates necessary parameters, including Jacobians and covariance matrices.
- **Visualization**: Provides graphical representation of the data and results.
- **ZOD and FOD Calculations**: Performs additional optimization and adjustments based on user inputs.

## Usage

1. Run the script in MATLAB.
2. Follow the on-screen menu options to choose the desired project and operations.
3. Input necessary data and parameters as prompted.
4. Review and analyze the results based on the generated plots and output files.

## Notes

- Ensure that the data files (e.g., `Lines.txt`, `Angles.txt`, `firstCoordinate.txt`) are correctly formatted and available in the specified paths.
- Adjust error values and other parameters according to the specifics of your geodetic network project.
